##  Becoming an Agile Project Manager and Achieving PMI-ACP Certification

### Why is this training important?
-   Confusion about PMI-ACP Certification - Some people may think that:
    -   Getting PMI-ACP certification is a matter of buying an "exam prep" book or taking an "exam prep" training course and going out and taking the exam
    -   Once you've taken and passed the exam, that is your "ticket" to get a job working in an Agile environment as a project manager
-   Agile Adoption has doubles since 2009
    -   A Forrester study from 2009 observed that 35% of organizations used Agile
    -   Actuation Consulting's 2013 research shows that 73.68% have adopted agile to develop products
-   The rapid growth and proliferation of Agile methodologies has added to the confusion that has already existed in this area
-   "Agile" is becoming a hot new buzz word and everyone wants to jump on the "Agile bandwagon"
-   Just becoming "Agile" is not necessarily the most important goal in itself depending on the nature of the business you're in
-   Agile is very similar to Six Sigma :
    -   There was a lot of hype about it
    -   A lot of people got lost in the mechanics of Six Sigma
    -   People tended to think that Six Sigma was a panacea for any possible problem that a business could have, and
    -   They tended to regard all other previous process improvement methodologies as obsolete and no longer relevant
-   While Agile has huge potential advantages for a business, I think it's important not to get lost in some of the hype that exists about Agile and objectively understand the differences between an Agile approach and a traditional project management approach and the benefits and limitations of each
-   Agile will have a major impact on the project management profession
-   It "raises the bar" significantly for project managers
-   This training will help you understand the impact of Agile on the project management profession and adapt your career as necessary to take advantage of the new opportunities it presents

### Learning Path and Course Overview
-   This course is not just a PMI-ACP "exam prep" course
    -   There are a lot of PMI-ACP "exam prep" courses out there and simply preparing for the exam has limited value
    -   Developing a course that helps you prepare for a real-world role in addition to preparing for the exam has a lot more value
-   Putting the information in a real-world context will not only help you prepare for a real-world role, it will also make the information more meaningful and easier to retain
-   A Big Challenge
    -   The role of an "Agile Project Manager" is somewhat undefined and is even somewhat controversial
    -   We need to better define and understand what that role is and it isn't limited to project managers
-   Agile is changing the very nature of "Project Management". You typically won't find anyone with the title of "Project Manager" at the team level in an Agile project, but there is a lot of "Project Management going on"

### What is Agile Project Management
-   Is "Agile Project Management" an Oxymoron?
    -   There has been a lot of polarization between the Agile community and the project management community for a number of years
-   Many people have the opinion that Agile and traditional project management principles and practices are mutually-exclusive of each other and in conflict with each other
-   Agile and traditional project management principles and practices have been treated as separate and independent domains of knowledge with little or no integration between the two
-   The roots of how we do project management today go back to the 1950's and 1960's and haven't changed significantly since that time
-   The pace of new technology has increased dramatically and calls for a new project management approach
-   Getting a PMP and PMI-ACP are going in the right direction but much more needs to be done
-   The agile movement forces project managers to consider a much broader range of "recipes" and "ingredients to cook with" and requires a much more customized and tailored approach
-   The challenge for Project Managers
    -   In the not-too-distant future, a Project Manager who only knows how to do plan-driven project management will be like a carpenter who only knows how to use a hammer
-   This course will help you reshape your career direction as needed to take advantages of some of the new opportunities in this area
-   Summary : What is an Agile Project Manager?
    -   An Agile Project Manager is not someone who only knows how to practice Agile
    -   An Agile Project Manager understands both traditional plan-driven project management and Agile principles and practices
    -   And he/she knows how to blend them together in the right proportions to fit a given situation
-   You have to fit the right approach to the project rather than force-fitting a project to a single approach
