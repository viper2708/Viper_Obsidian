## Core concepts

*  The shift to multi-everything
    *  Multi-Cloud
        *  Where we are running
        *  Massive transition taking place from traditional on-premises data centres into a mix of public and next generation private clouds
    *  Multi-Platform
        *  Where we are running
        *  From physical and virtual machines to containers, serverless capabilities, functions, or higher-level APIs provided on-demand
    *  Multi-Architectures
        *  Type and style of application architectures
        *  From monolithic to microservices and service-oriented architectures

*  What is next generation Private Cloud
    *  It provided Multi-Platform capabilities and allows Multi-Architectures hosting
        *  Client-agnostic consumption model : API-first
        *  In line with Cloud Service Providers and market standards
        *  Suited for Cloud Native Applications and DevSecOps practices
        *  Unique and standard service catalog
        *  Pay-per-use billing model
        *  Relies on Foundation services:
            *  Identity and Access Management
            *  Metrology
            *  Monitoring
            *  Alerting
            *  Secret
            *  Certificate
            *  Showback
        *  Is deployed in several regions and availability zones

*  What about AWS public cloud?
    *  AWS created the cloud IaaS market with the 2006 introduction of its Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2)
    *  69 availability zones within 22 geographical regions
    *  Offers the richest suite of public cloud IaaS capabilities, along with deep and broad PaaS-layer capabilities
    *  Addresses both ends of the spectrum spanning traditional and cloud-native applications
    *  Solid feature set, platform resiliency and maturity
    *  Meets most requirements for security and regulatory compliance

*  What about Azure public cloud?
    *  Azure was initially a PaaS launched in 2010. IaaS VMs(Azure Virtual Machines) were launched in June 2012 and became generally available in April 2013
    *  54 geographical regions
    *  Combines a rich suite of IaaS and PaaS capabilities within an integrated solution portfolio
    *  Customers are likely to consider Azure for use cases where the application is Windows-based, written in .NET, developed by a team using Microsoft developer tools like Visual Studio or dependent on Microsoft middleware
    *  Microsoft is also increasingly targeting applications that run on Linux and now includes broad support for popular open-source applications

*  Cloud Platform is a Multi-Cloud Platform
    *  GTS intends to manage Multiple Clouds with the right level of Hybridization
        *  Multiple Clouds
            *  Next Gen Private Cloud + AWS + Azure
            *  Native public clouds API documentation
            *  Public clouds governance and security
        *  Workflow portability through infrastructure as code approach
        *  Application portability through cross-cloud container orchestration
        *  Hybrid services
            *  Showback
            *  Hybrid Connectivity
            *  Service Meshing
            *  Hybrid Integration
            *  Orchestration

*  How to consume services?
    *  Dev, Sec, Fin, Ops Toolchains and Teams
    *  3 ways to interact with the platform
        *  Through API
        *  CLI
        *  DoItNow
    *  The platform is a collection of unitary infrastructure services(called XaaS) autonomously developed and maintained by a service producer(Component team)
    *  A resource is any infrastructure element that supports a business application (e.g. a VM, database, VIP, DNS record, certificate,...)

*  Cloud platform services are made for cloud native applications
    *  API-first design
    *  Regions and availability zones(AZ)
    *  Global (inter Regions/AZ) and local(AZ) traffic loan balancing
    *  OpenStack Compute
    *  Orchestrated containers for microservices
    *  Messaging and datalakes solutions

*  About delivery organisation and governance
    *  GTS teams deliver highest business value in short program increments
        *  Principles
            *  Alignement

            *  Program execution
        *  Strategic themes
            *  Adoption and onboarding
            *  Production-grade and security
            *  Unrivalled customer experience
            *  Cloud-Native and Multi-Cloud foundations

*  Finally, you application in cloud platform is
    *  Provisioned and maintained through a console or a fully automated CI/CD pipeline
    *  Composed of a bunch of Cloud services (Cloud Platform services and native CSP) executed within a Private Cloud, public or hybrid Cloud deployment model
    *  Optimized for Cloud
        *  Containerized
        *  Resilient (AZ or Region loss)
        *  Self-monitored
    *  Supported by GTS DEVOPS feature-teams and OPM Control Tower
    *  Charged on a Pay-per-Use model

## Service catalog

*  How is organized Cloud Platform service catalog?
    *  Service management
        *  Proviosion and manage your cloud services through portals, Command Line Interfaces, or direct API calls, get a consistent view on all deployed assets, get visibility on service billing and obtain assistance
    *  Operations
        *  Monitor your cloud services, be alerted in case of specific events, get all logs and metrics, obtain deep dive analytics (KYC, health,...) througn observability

        *  Access in a secure manner to you cloud services, manage your certificates and your secrets
    *  Infrastructure Services
        *  Consume private compute, storage, data protection and network cloud services
    *  Platform services
        *  Consume private database, messaging, application and analytics cloud services
    *  Public cloud
        *  Obtain secured training, innovation or production environments for all your public cloud use cases and enjoy CSP service catalogs
    *  Hybrid services
        *  Build an hybrid application between private and public clouds and guarantee end-to-end security
    *  Marketplace
