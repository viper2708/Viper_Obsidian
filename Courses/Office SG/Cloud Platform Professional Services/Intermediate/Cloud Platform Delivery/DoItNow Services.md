## Principles and concepts

*  What is DoItNow?
    *  DoItNow is the web-console of Cloud Platform. It offers an interface for all Societe Generale users who want to discover and use Cloud services.
    *  Cloud Platform objective is to allow its users to consume API to build Cloud native applications. DoItNow acts exactly as a user by calling any service's API on his behalf
    *  We do not aim at creating workflows or operations that cannot be achieved through API by a user

*  The main objectives are:
    *  To help developers to discover and understand Cloud services
    *  To gather information for Account Leaders to manage their applications
