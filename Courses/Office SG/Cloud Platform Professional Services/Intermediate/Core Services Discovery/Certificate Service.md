## Principles and concepts

* What is a certificate and why do we need it?
    * A server certificate is a digital certificate issued by a trusted third party (the trusted certified authority)
    * A digital certificate can be compared to an identity card issued by a government, that acts as a trusted third party
    * SG trusted party is named Unipass
    * SSL server certificate is a digital certificate used to initialize a secured connection through secure communication protocols like SSL or TLS between a client and a server or between two servers
    * Secured connection allows data encryption between client and server to avoid unauthorized access or sensitive data to be stolen, as client credit card details or credentials
    * When a secured connection is implemented, your browser displays a locker to point out that you have moved from a non-encrypted / non-secured connection (HTTP) to an encrypted / secured connection (HTTPS)
    * In addition to data encryption, certificate allows authentication as it's bond to :
        * An internet fully qualified domain name
        * An organization

## Use cases

* Encrypt data transmitted between a Web application and client browser
* Encrypt data transmitted between two applications
* Encrypt data transmitted between an application and database

## Available features and usages

* Which features are available?
    * Get an Unipass server certificate
    * List and retrieve existing certificates
    * Be notified when a certificate is about to expire
    * Disable notification for certificates that are no longer used
    * Revoke a certificate in case of security reasons
