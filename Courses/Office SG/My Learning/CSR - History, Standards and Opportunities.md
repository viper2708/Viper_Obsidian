##  CSR : Going From Obligation to Mission

* Reducing our carbon footprint, fighting unemployment or encouraging gender parity: without realizing it, we run into CSR issues every day. But what is CSR, and why is it crucial for companies today?

### Corporate Social Responsibility
* Corporate Social Responsibility, or CSR, consists of incorporating economic, social and environmental issues into a company's strategy, to make a positive contribution to society and sustainable development while making sure to still remain economically viable

### CSR as a Simple Constraint
* The growing challenges posed by environmental and social issues are forcing governments to put in place regulations to encourage companies to be more responsible.
* Whereas a company must above all be profitable, investing in sustainable development could represent unnecessary costs created by the simple constraint of having to comply with the laws and standards in force
* Yet if it's integrated into the company's business model, CSR can actively contribute to its profitability!

### Image and Stakeholders
* Adapting to the needs and expectations of all of its stakeholders is an essential part of the proper functioning of a company
* Employees, investors and consumers increasingly take brand positions and commitments into account
* This is how Nespresso single-use capsules have in just a few years gone from being a flagship product to a real burden for the coffee giant: to respond to consumer pressure, the company is now showcasing responsible approaches and a recycling program for its aluminum capsules
* By committing to having a positive impact on the planet and society, the company is securing the support of its entire ecosystem and engaged in a virtuous circle

### Long Tern Vision
* CSR requires companies to plan for the long term by anticipating the climate and energy risks linked to their activities
* In 2015, COP21 created the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures to study climate-related financial risks. The TCFD estimates that climate change will cost the economy several trillion dollars. Investors, shareholders and insurers, who aim for long-term profitability, are also putting pressure on companies to take care not to neglect environmental and social challenges

### From Constraint to Mission
* CSR is gradually becoming an absolute necessity for companies, to the point of sometimes being at the very heart of their strategy. This is the case for the French sneaker brand VEJA: its very identity is based on fair trade and responsible production
* For these companies with innovative business models, CSR has gone from being a constraint to being a source of opportunities and profit!

##  CSR at the International Level: Standards and Regulations
* While CSR is by nature an international concern, not all countries give it the same importance or the same definition. It can therefore be difficult to have a clear vision of things. Let's take closer look at them

### The UNs SDGs
* Let's start with the SDGs, for Sustainable Development Goals: in 2015, the United Nations set 17 SDGs to be achieved by 2030. These revolve around 5 pillars: planet, population, prosperity, peace and partnerships
* For a company, identifying the SDGs that are relevant to its business sector is a good way to develop its CSR strategy. It's no longer a question of simply limiting the company's negative impact, but of actively integrating these global objectives into its business development strategy
* For the fashion and textile industry, for example, the goal clean water and sanitation is a major challenge to limit the depletion of the planet's scarce drinking water resources. The polluting products it uses are also an issue as regards the goals health and well-being and preserving the biodiversity of aquatic and terrestrial life

### The ISO 26000 standard
* Like the SDGs, the ISO 26000 standard sets a common framework and guidelines at the international level
* Adopted in 2010, it is today the authoritative benchmark in terms of sustainable development. It's often found at the heart of a company's CSR strategy
* ISO 26000 is based on 7 lines of thinking around best practices in human rights, the environment and ethics. For example, informing consumers in a transparent manner
* Designed as a guide based on a series of recommendations, it offers guidance for companies without imposing binding obligations on them

### Software and National Regulations
* ISO 26000 and ODD are not binding on companies, as they constitute no legal obligation per se. We speak here of "soft law". Some consulting companies now offer solutions consisting of advising companies on ways to define business-sector-specific means of action
* However, these international instruments provide guidelines that more and more countries are translating into their national law. While CSR in the United States is still largely based on voluntary and philanthropic initiatives, the countries of the European Union are transposing the European directive requiring large companies to carry out extra-financial reporting, including their CO2 emissions, into their national laws
* The international framework hence guides governments to evolve their national legislation on the one hand, and companies to anticipate this evolution on the other

## Identify and measure: A user's Guide to CSR
* The scope of CSR is broad and comprehensive. When national or sector-specific particularities are also taken into consideration, it can become understandably difficult to know where to start!

### Identifying the players and issues involved
* The first thing to do when deciding to adopt a CSR approach is to map the risks and opportunities that are specific to your business sector. To do this, you need to know and consult your stakeholders, to identify the possibilities for joint action. The stakeholders can be internal, such as employees, or external, such as consumers or public authorities
* For example, organic products or animal welfare are central issues for many consumers today. And as a result, they are also becoming essential for the food and textile sectors
* In the same way, the positive impact a company has on society is a powerful lever for recruitment, especially among young workers, and a factor in reducing job turnover. This situation is prompting large groups such as Total to set themselves bold CSR objectives

### Give yourself the means to achieve your goals
* But beware of greenwashing, this tendency companies have of giving themselves false image of responsible and ethical concern. Declared ambitions are not always synonymous with concrete actions. Once the issues and stakeholders have been identified, you must give yourself the means to achieve your goals
* A genuine CSR approach begins with concrete and measurable goals that are specific to your business activity. IKEA made a commitment to be using 100% responsible wood by the end of 2020. Between 2017 and 2019, the percentage rose from 77% to 91%
* There must also be agreement on these means: is CSR solely the concern of a separate department, or does it concern all the teams inside a company? Is there a dedicated budget, and how are CSR-related KPIs integrated into the company's overall KPIs?

### CSR strategy vs Impact strategy
* In addition to voluntary initiatives, certifications, labels and rating agencies are good ways to guarantee the credibility of a CSR approach. For example, the B Corporation certification, obtained by Ben and Jerry's in 2012, is an international benchmark
* But for companies that have opted for an impact strategy, merely reducing the negative externalities associated with their activity is not enough. They must instead be committed to actively improving their contribution to society. For example, by investing part of their turnover in an ecological or social cause, as Patagonia has been doing since 1985
* Reducing negative impact with CSR, or generating positive impacts with an impact strategy
