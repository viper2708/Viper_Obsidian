* Faced with the increasing use of personal data in all economic sectors and in response to the concerns expressed by citizens, legislative measures are being strengthened to provide a better framework for the use of personal data, to guarantee its protection and to extend the rights of data subjects.
* The European Parliament has adopted a regulatory text that governs the processing of personal data within the European Economic Area (EEA)
* This text, called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), came into force on 25 May 2018

## GDPR
* It aims to:
	* Strengthen the rights of individuals
		* The GDPR offers data subjects greater transparency in the use of their data, notably through better information and strengthening of their rights
	* Strengthen the accountability of organizations that process personal data
		* The GDPR imposes new requirements on organizations that process personal data and introduces the principle of accountability
		* This obliges organizations to implement internal mechanisms and procedures to demonstrate compliance with data protection rules
	* Harmonize all legislation at European level
		* The GDPR harmonizes the laws of Member States on the protection of personal data
		* However, some specific local dispositions may exist
* Since the GDPR came into force, other countries outside the European Union have also changed their personal data protection regulations
	* European Union
		* May 2018 : General Data Protection Regulation
	* Japan
		* June 2020 : Act of Protection of Personal Information
	* South Africa
		* July 2020 : Protection of Personal Information Act
	* Brazil
		* August 2020 : General Data Protection Law
	* New Zealand
		* December 2020 : Privacy Act
	* China
		* November 2021 : Personal Information Protection Law
* As trusted third parties, banks are particularly sensitive to the protection of data they process
	* Service providers
	* Suppliers
	* Other partners
* As Societe Generale employees, we are all affected in our daily lives by the use of personal data. Awareness of current regulations is therefore essential.
* Through this module, you will learn to :
	* Master the basic concepts
	* Be aware of who is involved
	* Understand the application framework
	* Learn the main principles to be followed
	* Understand the rights of individuals over their data
	* Recognize a data breach and respond appropriately
	* And use your common sense, because the GDPR often comes down to the application of simple principles

## GDPR : Who, What, How?
* Personal data is any information relating to a natural person that can be used, directly or indirectly, to identify that specific person
* Personal data
	* Private email address
	* Personal phone number
	* Health information
	* Work email address
	* Work phone number
	* Salary amount
* Be careful, however, not to confuse personal data with private data!
* Whether in a private or professional context, data relating to an indentifiable person remains personal data
* In addition , there are special categories of personal data known as "sensitive data" within the meaning of the GDPR
	* Racial or ethnic origin
	* Political opinions
	* Religious or philosophical beliefs
	* Trade union membership
	* Genetic data
	* Biometric data
	* Data concerning health
	* Sex life or sexual orientation
* This sensitive data is subject to greater attention and it use is strictly regulated
* With the development of digital technology, new types of data have emerged : Cookies
	* These are trackers that collect information related to browsing activity
		* Sesame ID / Username
		* IP address
		* Browsing history
	* When, alone or combined with other data, they can identify an individual, cookies are considered personal data and must comply with the regulations
* Now that we have seen what personal data is, let us turn to the concept of data processing
	* Personal data processing is a use of that data, which can take several forms
		* Collection
		* Recording
		* Modification
		* Viewing
		* Distribution
	* The concept of "processing" is very broad : the simple fact of collecting or accessing data is considered as processing! This applies to both digital and paper files
		* Examples of processing
			* Payroll management
			* Creation of a directory
			* Direct marketing
			* Physical access management
* The GDPR applies to organizations (companies associations, etc.) according to their location and/or the location of the individuals whose data they process
* An organization located in the EEA is affected by the GDPR regardless of the location of the individuals whose data it processes
* By harmonizing European legislation, the GDPR facilitates the free movement of personal data within the EEA
	* However, transfers of personal data outside the EEA are strictly regulated
	* Transfers of personal data to a non-EEA country are authorized if that country is recognized as "adequate" by the European Commission
		* To be "adequate", a non-EEA country must be have legislation equivalent to the GDPR
	* Even when personal data is stored within the EEA, the mere fact that it can be accessed from outside the EEA is considered to be a transfer outside the EEA, and must therefore be regulated!

## GDPR participants
* Let's now look at the various participants involved in the protection of personal data
* Data Subject
	* Data subjects are the natural persons whose personal data is processed.
	* Examples
		* Customer
		* User
		* Employee
		* Shareholder
* Data controller
	* A "data controller" is any natural or legal person who manages personal data
		* The Group has identified more than 100 different Data Controllers, corresponding to different legal statuses (subsidiaries, branches, Service Units within SGPM, etc.)
	* Collects the data
	* Decides how the data is processed
* Data processor
	* Any natural or legal person (supplier, service provider, etc.) who carries out all or part of the processing on behalf of a data controller is considered a data processor
		* Data processors may be external or internal to the Group
		* Thus, a Group entity may act both as data controller and data processor depending on the processing carried out
	* The data processor's obligations in terms of personal data protection must be mentioned in the contract between the data processor and the data controller
* Data Protection Authority
	* Data Protection Authorities are independent public authorities that monitor the application of data protection legislation
	* Each EU Member State has its own Data Protection Authority
	* Role of a Data Protection Authority
		* Provide expert advice (guidelines, recommendations, etc.) on data protection issues
		* Monitor the application of the regulations and impose sanctions in the event of non-compliance
		* Deal with complaints about breaches of the GDPR and national data protection laws
* Data Protection Officer
	* The Data Protection Officer (DPO) is designated by a data controller as the point of contract for the Data Protection Authority of their country
	* DPO must be able to carry out their duties independently
		* Within the Societe Generale Group, the DPOs are attached to the Compliance department
		* The Group DPO (CPLE/DPO) reports to the Group Head of Compliance
	* DPO's role
		* Manage GDPR compliance within their organization
		* Support and advise the organization's internal departments
		* Cooperate with the Data Protection AUthorities
		* Be the point of contact for data subjects

## Main principles
* Processing of personal data must respect the following principles:
	* Be lawful (lawfulness)
		* Let's start with the lawfulness of a processing activity
		* In order to be lawful, a processing activity must be based on one of the six legal bases provided for by the GDPR
			* Performance of a contract
				* Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party
				* This legal basis may apply
					* When a contract is signed
						* Example : Processing related to payroll (performance of the employment contract)
					* For the purpose of signing a contract
						* Example : Processing related to the provision of a quote
			* Legal obligation
				* Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the data controller is subject
				* This legal basis is often used by the Group, as the bank operates in a highly regulated environment
					* Example : KYC process, anti-money laundering, etc.
			* Protecting the vital interests of the individual
				* Processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of a natural person
				* This legal basis is limited to situations where the lives of individuals are at stake, it is very rarely used in a banking context
					* Example : Hospital admission, health crisis situation, etc.
			* Performance of a public interest risk
				* Processing is necessary for the performance of a public interest responsibility conferred on the data controller
				* The use of this legal basis mainly concerns public authorities and is very rarely used within the bank
					* Example : Specific processing related to the activities of public bodies, such as ministries, town halls, tax authorities, etc.
			* Consent
				* Data subjects must give free, specific and informed consent to the processing of their data
				* They must be able to withdraw their consent at any time as easily as they gave it
				* Consent must result from a positive act (no pre-ticked box)
			* Legitimate interest
				* This legal basis applies to processing activities that do not fall under the previous legal bases but are nonetheless necessary for the activity of the data controller
				* The use of this legal basis requires the data controller to demonstrate and document that the interests pursued do not create an imbalance to the detriment of the rights and interests of the persons whose data is processed
					* Example : Ensuring business development, guaranteeing the security of your assets
	* Pursue defined and limited objectives (purpose limitation)
		* Processing must have a specific and explicit purpose
		* The data must not be used for purposes other than those for which it was collected
	* Be carried out in a transparent manner (transparency)
		* The controller must inform the data subjects of the processing it carries out on their data
		* This information must be
			* Concise
			* Expressed in clear, simple, and easily understandable terms
			* Easily accessible
	* Use only the data that is strictly necessary (minimization)
		* Only data strictly necessary for the processing may be collected and used
		* No data may be collected "just in case"
	* Use accurate and up-to-data (accuracy)
		* The personal data processed must be accurate and kept up to date
	* Keep data for a limited time (storage limitation)
		* The data collected must be kept for a limited period
		* This period must be consistent and justified in relation to the purpose of the processing
		* The data controller must therefore put in place a data erasure mechanism and ensure that the data is completely deleted at the end of this period
	* Be secure (security)
		* Personal data must be processed and stored in a secure manner to protect it from any risk of loss, disclosure, alteration, or destruction
		* Examples :
			* Password
			* Backup
			* Encryption
		* A policy governing the security of personal data has been defined by the Group's IT Security department

* One of the main compliance tools is the record of processing activities
	* The data controller lists all the personal data processing activities carried out by the organization, gives a detailed description (purpose of the processing, data processed, operational methods, etc.) and ensures they are kept up to date
		* Employee training management
		* Management of customer's electronic account statements
		* Organization and management of competitions
		* Management of access to premises
	* Several participants are involved in this process
		* Business / Operational staff
			* For the needs of its activity, implements personal data processing in compliance with the Group's rules
			* Alerts in the event of a data breach
			* Participates, if necessary, in the processing of data subjects' rights requests
		* Data management office
			* Keeps the register of personal data processing activities of the entity concerned
			* Provides level 1 support to operational staff
		* Data Protection Officer / Data Protection Correspondent (LOD2 Compliance)
			* Checks compliance, advises and supports those involved throughout the life of a processing activity
			* Is the main contact for data protection authorities, particularly in the event of an inspection or complaint

## Rights of individuals
* The GDPR has strengthened the rights of individuals in relation to the uses made of their data
* Individuals can exercise their rights with data controllers in a variety of ways : by post or email, orally (e.g. with an adviser), using dedicated digital pathways, etc.
* Right
	* Of access
		* The right of access allows the data subjects:
			* To find out weather data relating to them is being processed by the data controller
			* To obtain a copy in an intelligible format
			* To obtain information about the processing of their data
	* To rectification
		* The right to rectification allows data subjects to obtain correction of inaccurate or incomplete information concerning them
			* Modification or addition of data
	* To object
		* The right to object allows data subjects to object, on legitimate grounds, to the processing of their personal data by a data controller
		* In the event of objection to direct marketing, the customer does not need to give reasons for the request
	* To erasure
		* The right to erasure allows data subjects to ask the data controller to erase personal data concerning them
		* The data controller may refuse where legal or regulatory requirements require it to retain the data
	* To restriction of processing
		* The right to restriction of processing allows data subjects to request a temporart freeze on the use of some of their personal data in cases provided for by the regulations
		* Data subjects must specify the data whose use they wish to limit and give reasons for the request
			* For example, the processing of data may be "frozen" for the time needed to resolve a dispute or a challenge
	* To portability
		* The right to portability allows data subjects to request the recovery of some of their data, collected with their consent or for the purposes of a contract, in a structured digital format (e.g. Excel file)
		* They may request that their data be transmitted directly to another organization
* The data controller has one month to respond to a rights request
* This period may be extended by two months in certain cases (complex requests or volume of requests) and after notifying the data subject

### Summary
* Data protection regulations give rights to individuals whose data os being processed
* The organisation has one month to respond to requests to exercise these rights
* Upon receipt of a request to exercise a right, it should be forwarded to the line manager or directly to the Data Protection Correspondent (DPC) or the Data Protection Officer (DPO) of the relevant entity

## Data Breach
* The GDPR requires a data controller to:
	* have mechanisms for detecting personal data breaches
	* record breaches in a register
	* analyze the impact of a breach on data subjects
	* notify the Data Protection Authority in the event of a breach with a significant impact
	* or even to notify the data subjects themselves
		* If it detects a personal data breach, a data processor must notify its data controller activity
		* After detecting a personal data breach, the data processor has 72 hours to notify the Data Protection Authority
		* It is therefore essential to raise an alert immediately in case of a breach

* A personal data breach is a security incident :
	* Of malicious origin or otherwise
	* Occurring intentionally or unintentionally
	* That comprises confidentiality, integrity or availability of personal data

* Examples of data breach include :
	* Theft or loss of laptop containing customer information
	* Mistakenly sending an email containing personal data to the wrong recipient
	* A server failure preventing customers from accessing their personal data for a significant period
	* Ransomware (taking personal data "hostage" by malicious encryption and then demanding a ransom)

### Summary
* A data breach in the sense of the GDPR is any type of incident resulting in a loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability of personal data
* As soon as a breach is identified, it should be reported as soon as possible to the Data Protection Correspondent of the area concerned
* The Correspondent is responsible for assessing the severity of the breach, in conjunction with the relevant teams, and for making a recommendation on the need to notify the Data Protection Authority and where appropriate, the data subjects
* When required, the notification must be made within 72 hours of the identification of the breach
* The Data Protection Correspondent must document the data breach in a register
