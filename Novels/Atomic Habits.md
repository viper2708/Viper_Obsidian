## The Fundamentals : Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference

  

### The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

  

*  Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every daycounts for a lot in the long run

*  Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is whyunderstanding the details is essential.

*  Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. Themost powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.

*  An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.

*  If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.

*  You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of you systems.

  

### How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

  

*  There are three levels of change : outcome change, process change, and identity change.

*  The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, button who you wish to become.

*  Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

*  Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.

*  The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

  

### How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

  

*  A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.

*  The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.

*  Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps :
	*  Cue
	*  Craving
	*  Response
	*  Reward

*  The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are:
	*  Make it obvious
	*  Make it attractive
	*  Make it easy
	*  Make it satisfying

  
## The 1st Law : Make It Obvious

  

### The Man Who Didn’t Look Right

  

*  With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomeswithout consciously thinking about it.

*  Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.

*  The process of behavious change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of yourhabits before you can change them.

*  Pointing-and-calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconsious habit to a moreconscious level by verbalizing your actions.

*  The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behaviour

  

### The Best Way to Start a New Habit

  

*  The first law of behavious change is make it obvious

*  The two most common cues are time and location

*  Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with aspecific time and location.

*  The implementation intention formula is : "I will [BEHAVIOUR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]".

*  Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit

*  The habit stacking formula is : "After [CURRENT HABIT], i will [NEW HABIT]".

  

### Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More

  

*  Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behaviour over time

*  Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.

*  Make the cues of good habits obvious in you environment

*  Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour. The context becomes the cue.

*  It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.

  

### The Secret to Self-Control

  

*  The inversion of the 1st Law of Behaviour Change is make it invisible.

*  Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.

*  People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It's easier to avoid temptation that resist it.

*  One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue thatcauses it.

*  Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.

  

## The 2nd Law : Make It Attractive

  

### How to Make a Habit Irresistible

  

*  The 2nd Law of Behaviour Change is make it attractive

*  The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming

*  Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.

*  It is the anticipation of a reward - not the fulfillment of it - that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.

*  Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do

  

### The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits

  

*  The culture we live in determines which behaviours are attractive to us.

*  We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe

*  We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups : the close (family and friends), the many (tribe), and the powerful(those with status and prestige)

*  One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where
	*  Your desired behavior is the normal behavior
	*  You already have something in common with the group

*  The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we'd rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves

*  If a behaviour can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive

  

### How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits

  

*  The inversion of the 2nd Law of Behaviour Change is make it unattractive

*  Every behaviour has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive

*  Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.

*  The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling

*  Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive

*  Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit

  

## The 3nd Law : Make it Easy

  

### Walk Slowly, but Never Backward

  

*  The 3rd Law of Behaviour Change is make it easy

*  The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning

*  Focus on taking action, not being in motion

*  Habit formation is the process by which a behaviour becomes progressively more automatic through repetition

*  The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it

  

### The Law of Least Effort

  

*  Human behaviour follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work

*  Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible

*  Reduce the friction associated with good behaviours. When friction is low, habits are easy.

*  Increase the friction associated with bad behaviours. When frictionis high, habits are difficult

*  Prime your environment to make future actions easier

  

### How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule

  

*  Habits are completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behaviour for minutes or hours afterwards

*  Many habits occur at decisive moments - choices that are like a fork in the road - and either send you in a direction of a productive day or an unproductive one

*  The Two-Minute Rule states, "When you start a new habit, it should take less that 2 minutes to do"

*  The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things

*  Standardize before you optimize. You can't improve a habit that doesn't exist

  

### How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible

  

*  The inversion of the 3rd Law of Behaviour Change is make it difficult

*  A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behaviour in thefuture

*  The ultimate way to lock in future behaviour is to automate your habits

*  Onetime choices - like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan - are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time

*  Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right Behaviour

  

## The 4th Law : Make It Satisfying

  

### The Cardinal Rule of Behaviour Change

  

*  The 4th Law of Behaviour Change is make it satisfying

*  We are more likely to repeat a behaviour when the experience is satisfying

*  The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards

*  The Cardinal Rule of Behaviour Change : What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided

*  To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful - even if it's in a small way

*  The first three laws of behaviour change - make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy increase the odds that a behaviour will be performed this time. The fourth law of behaviourn change - make it satisfying - increases the odds that a behaviour will be repeated next time

  

### How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day

  

*  One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress

*  A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit - like marking an X on a calendar

*  Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress

*  Don't break the chain. Try to keep you habit streak alive

*  Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible.

*  Just because you can measure something doesn't mean it's the most important thing

  

### How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything

  

*  The inversion of the 4th Law of Behaviour Change is make it unsatisfying

*  We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying

*  An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us

*  A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behaviour. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful

*  Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator

  

## Advanced tactics : How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great

  

### The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t)

*  The secret of maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition

*  Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle

*  Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favourable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavourable circumstances

*  Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suits you

*  Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can't find a game that favors you, create one

*  Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on

  

### The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work

*  The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities

*  The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom

*  As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored

*  Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It's the ability to keep going when work isn't exciting that makes the difference

*  Professionals stick to the schedule, amateurs let life get in the way

  

### The Downside of Creating Good Habits

*  The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors

*  Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery

*  Reflection and review is a process that allows you to maintain conscious of your performace over time

*  The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it
